/**
 * Generates test cases and greedily optimizes the resulting test suite with regards to coverage criteria as
 * given in an {@link osmo.tester.coverage.ScoreConfiguration}.
 * Resulting suite is optimised so the first test in the given set has the highest overall coverage score values,
 * the second one adds most score to that one as evaluated in terms of single test cases, the third adds the most
 * to these two, and so on.
 * New test cases are generated as long as the optimization of the suite in an iteration yields a higher value
 * than the previous iterations.
 * Best tests (ones that added anything to the suite score) are kept for the next round.
 * Each round (iteration) consists of generating a set of tests. The number of tests generated is equal to the
 * population size defined in the configuration.
 * The threshold to keep generating more tests is if any added score is observed.
 * This version generates test cases sequentially, using a single core on a single machine.
 * For a multi-core version, check the {@link MultiGreedy} version. However, note that the parallel versions are
 * not deterministic in the exact test cases returned, only in the scores they give (or should be).
